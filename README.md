# IEEE 754 Single Precision Floating Point Visualization

Here is an interactive visualization of how single precision floating-point representation works.

# Installation

It is forked from the vizualization given at this talk at JSConf EU 2013 [Everything you never wanted to know about JavaScript numbers](http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/bartek-szopka-everything-you-never-wanted-to-know-about-javascript-numbers-and-you-didnt-know-you-could-ask.html) but improved and adapted for the single precision instead of a double precision.
