# IEEE 754 Single Precision Floating Point Visualization

It's an interactive visualization of how single precision floating point representation works.

It is forked from the vizualization given at this talk at JSConf EU 2013 [Everything you never wanted to know about JavaScript numbers](http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/bartek-szopka-everything-you-never-wanted-to-know-about-javascript-numbers-and-you-didnt-know-you-could-ask.html) but for the single precision.

# Installation
